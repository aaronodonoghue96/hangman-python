# Hangman

Hangman is a terminal game written in Python, and it runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The player must guess letters in an attempt to discover a hidden word. For each letter they guess correctly, it appears in the word once for every occurrence of that letter. If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one of their lives, and has to guess another letter. The game ends when either the player has guessed the full word, in which case they win, or they run out of lives, in which case they lose.
